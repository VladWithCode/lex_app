# Lex App

Built to help with tracking and ease of search for progress in legal procedures.

Uses Go and Wails to power the core of the app and React to enhance the UI to deliver an amazing, simple
and efficient workflow when working on multiple cases that require the user to be up to date with the
latest updates in their customers procedures.

### Installation note:

This app requires, as of version 'current version', poppler's pdftotext utility to work.
I'm working on removing all the 3rd party dependencies as possible, but for now it remains a requirement
for installation.
